# spot_the_surveillance

Spot the Surveillance is an open-source educational VR tool to help people identify street-level surveillance 
in their community. As each surveillance device is identified, the user is informed on how the device is used 
via text and narration. The experience is created with accessibility in mind, 
so is entirely gaze-based for people with mobility challenges. Audio is also used to assist low-vision users. 

A project of Electronic Frontier Foundation.
